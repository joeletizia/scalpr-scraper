/*** Craigslist Scraper ***/

You must have ruby and mechanize installed before you run this script.

Here's the easiest way to install mechanize:
http://rubygems.org/gems/mechanize

Use a clean working directory for scraping
$ mkdir ~/scraping
$ cd ~/scraping

Copy files from Downloads folder to [current] scraping folder
$ mv ~/Downloads/scalpr_scraping.zip .

Unzip scraper
$ unzip scalpr_scraping

Edit city list- names must be same as craigslist:
e.g. 'sanfrancisco' instead of 'San Francisco'
$ vim cities.txt

Run scraper
$ ./craigslist_scraper.rb cities.txt

A cities list must be specified. If not given, the scraper will only go through listings in SF
